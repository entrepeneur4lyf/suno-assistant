# Tag Library

This directory contains the comprehensive tag library for Suno Prompt Architect.

## Files

### `style-personality.json`
Raw style personality data containing adjectives, energy descriptions, and vocal styles for each tag. This is the source data provided by Suno documentation and community research.

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "tags": {
    "tag-name": {
      "adjectives": ["descriptive", "words"],
      "energy": "energy description",
      "vocal_style": "vocal style description"
    }
  }
}
```

### `full-library.json` (Generated)
Complete, structured tag library with 105+ tags across 7 categories. This file is auto-generated by the `build-tag-library.js` script and should not be edited manually.

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "generated_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "tag_count": 105,
  "categories": ["genre", "mood", "energy", ...],
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": "tag-id",
      "name": "Tag Name",
      "category": "genre|mood|energy|vocals|tempo|era|instruments",
      "description": "Human-readable description",
      "usage": "style|lyrics|both",
      "synonyms": [],
      "examples": ["example1", "example2"],
      "co_occurrence": {
        "strong": ["tag-ids that pair well"],
        "avoid": ["tag-ids that conflict"]
      },
      "metadata": {
        "adjectives": ["descriptive words"],
        "energy_description": "energy feel",
        "vocal_style": "vocal characteristics"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `sample-tags.json`
Initial sample tag library used during development. Superseded by `full-library.json`.

## Categories

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **genre** | 56 | Musical genres and subgenres (pop, rock, electronic, etc.) |
| **mood** | 24 | Emotional qualities and atmospheres (upbeat, dark, dreamy, etc.) |
| **instruments** | 11 | Prominent instruments and sounds (guitar, synth, piano, etc.) |
| **vocals** | 6 | Vocal types and styles (male voice, female vocals, etc.) |
| **energy** | 4 | Energy levels and intensity (aggressive, powerful, etc.) |
| **era** | 2 | Time periods and decades (80s, 90s) |
| **tempo** | 2 | Speed descriptors (slow, fast) |

## Usage Types

- **`style`**: Use in the Style prompt field (genres, instruments, production)
- **`lyrics`**: Use as structure tags in Lyrics (`[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, etc.)
- **`both`**: Can be used in either Style or Lyrics contexts

## Building the Tag Library

The tag library is automatically built during the app build process via the `prebuild` script. To manually rebuild:

```bash
npm run build:tags
```

This runs `scripts/build-tag-library.js` which:
1. Loads `style-personality.json`
2. Maps tags to appropriate categories
3. Infers usage types (style/lyrics/both)
4. Adds co-occurrence data
5. Generates structured descriptions
6. Outputs to `full-library.json`

## Adding New Tags

To add new tags to the library:

1. Edit `style-personality.json` and add your tag data:
```json
{
  "my-new-tag": {
    "adjectives": ["cool", "awesome"],
    "energy": "a vibrant and energetic feel",
    "vocal_style": "powerful and clear"
  }
}
```

2. Update `scripts/build-tag-library.js`:
   - Add category mapping in `CATEGORY_MAP`
   - Optionally add co-occurrence rules in `CO_OCCURRENCE`

3. Rebuild the library:
```bash
npm run build:tags
```

## Co-Occurrence Data

Co-occurrence data helps suggest complementary tags and warn about conflicts.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "pop": {
    "strong": ["upbeat", "catchy", "melodic"],
    "avoid": ["harsh", "experimental", "dark"]
  }
}
```

- **`strong`**: Tags that commonly pair well together
- **`avoid`**: Tags that typically conflict or contradict

This data powers:
- Tag suggestion chips in the UI
- Conflict detection in the Prompt Analyzer
- "Best pairs" in Tag Details view

## Data Sources

The style personality data is compiled from:
- Official Suno documentation
- Community tag glossaries
- User experimentation and testing
- Music theory and genre conventions

## Version History

- **v0.1.0** (2025-11-25): Initial tag library with 105 tags across 7 categories
